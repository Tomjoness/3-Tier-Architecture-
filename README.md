Twin Cities Web Application

Overview

This Twin Cities web application allows users to explore and compare two cities through an interactive digital interface. It integrates multiple data sources to present real-time weather, visual media, and local information. The aim is to demonstrate a full-stack web solution with API integration, user interaction, and dynamic content delivery.

The app serves as both a technical showcase and a practical tool for comparing two city locations side by side, making it useful for travel, study, or business users.

Key Features
	•	Interactive Mapping: Visual display of both city locations using an embedded map
	•	Live Weather Data: Real-time weather updates via an external Weather API
	•	Flickr Integration: Displays relevant images from each city using the Flickr API
	•	City Database: Local database stores and retrieves key static information such as population, landmarks, and time zones
	•	Dynamic UI: User inputs trigger updates across all data panels

Tools & Technologies
	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	•	Backend: PHP or Node.js (adapt to your tech stack)
	•	APIs:
	•	OpenWeatherMap API (or similar)
	•	Flickr API
